				<a href="https://github.com/EshaanSabharwal/tic-tac--toee">Project 1</a>
				<p><strong>Title: Tic Tac Toe Game</strong><br><br>

                    <strong>Description: </strong>
                    The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with either "X" or "O" until one player achieves a winning pattern or the grid is full, resulting in a draw. This project implements the Tic Tac Toe game using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling.<br>
                    <br>

                    <strong>Key Features:</strong><br> <br>
                    <strong>Responsive Design: </strong>The game is designed to be responsive, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.<br>
                    <strong>Interactive Gameplay:</strong> Players can click on the grid squares to place their moves, alternating between "X" and "O".<br>
                    <strong>Win Detection:</strong> The game checks for winning combinations after each move to determine if a player has won.<br>
                    <strong>Draw Detection:</strong> If all squares are filled and there is no winner, the game declares a draw.<br>
                    <strong>Visual Feedback:</strong> CSS styling provides visual feedback to players, highlighting the current player's turn and indicating winning combinations.<br><br>
                    <strong>Technologies Used:</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>HTML:</strong> Used to structure the game layout, including the grid and interactive elements.<br>
                    <strong>CSS:</strong> Employed for styling elements such as grid layout, colors, fonts, and animations to enhance the visual appeal.<br>
                    <strong>JavaScript:</strong> Though not explicitly mentioned, JavaScript would likely be used for implementing the game logic, including handling player moves, win detection, and updating the UI dynamically.

				<a href="https://github.com/EshaanSabharwal/Login-Registration">Project 2</a>
				<p><strong>Title:Login-Registration</strong> <br><br>

					<strong>Description:</strong></p>
					The Login & Register Page project is a web application that provides user authentication functionality, allowing users to create new accounts (register) and log in to existing accounts. This project employs both frontend and backend technologies to create a seamless user experience.
					<br><br>
		
					<strong>Key Features:</strong>
					<br><br>
					<strong>User Registration:</strong> Users can create new accounts by providing necessary information such as username, email, and password. The registration form validates input data and ensures uniqueness of usernames and emails.<br>
					<strong>User Authentication: </strong>Registered users can log in using their credentials (username/email and password) through the login form. The backend verifies the provided credentials and grants access if they are correct.<br>
					<strong>Session Management:</strong> Upon successful login, the application establishes a session for the user, allowing them to access restricted content without the need to re-authenticate for subsequent requests.<br>
					<strong>Password Hashing:</strong> Passwords are securely hashed before storing them in the database to ensure confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.<br>
					<strong>Error Handling: </strong>The application provides appropriate error messages for invalid input, duplicate usernames/emails during registration, and incorrect login credentials.<br>
					<strong>Responsive Design: </strong>The login and registration forms are designed to be responsive, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.<br><br>
					<strong>Technologies Used:</strong><br><br>
					<strong>Frontend:</strong><br>
					
					<strong>HTML:</strong> Used for structuring the login and registration forms.<br>
					<strong>CSS:</strong> Employed for styling elements such as forms, buttons, and layout to enhance the visual appeal.<br>
					<strong>JavaScript:</strong> Used for client-side form validation and interaction, providing real-time feedback to users.<br><br>
					<strong>Backend:</strong><br>
					<strong>Server-side language (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java):</strong> Handles HTTP requests, form submissions, and business logic.<br>
					<strong>Frameworks (e.g., Express.js, Flask, Spring Boot):</strong> Simplifies routing, middleware integration, and database interaction.<br>
					<strong>Database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB):</strong> Stores user account information securely.<br>
